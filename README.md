# Multithreading and Concurrancy in CPP

---

Multithreading and concurrency are essential concepts in software development, especially for performance-critical applications like camera imaging algorithms. Here's an overview of what you should know about these topics:

### Fundamental Concepts -

#### 1. Multithreading:

- There is always main thread() in each application, it's default thread, In this thread only we create other threads.
- Achieve parallelism by diving a process into multiple threads.
- A thread is also lightweight process.
- Ways to create Threads in C++ -
   - 1. Function Pointers
     2. Lambda Functions
     3. Member Functions
     4. Static member functions
- Performace is currency of computing.


#### Parallelism vs Concurrancy -
- Concurrancy is often used interchangeably with parallelism - so lets separate those 2 terms ->
- 1.Concurrancy we have to keep in mid the synchronization, we have to wait on shared resoy=urces/ threads to finish their tasks,
- Parallelism - everything happens at once, instataneously
